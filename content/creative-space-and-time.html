                <p>Software engineering is driven by human creativity and problem-solving. For some, it is even regarded
                    as a form of art.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Space</strong> allows engineers, as people, to choose their projects, methods, and
                        tools. This freedom encourages personal expression and unique approaches to solving problems.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Time</strong> gives engineers the ability to set their own pace for releasing features,
                        working on them, collaborating and making improvements. This flexibility supports thoughtful
                        exploration and refinement.</li>
                </ul>
