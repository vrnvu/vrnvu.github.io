                <h2>The Creative Process and Self-Teaching</h2>

                <img src="../images/bill-evans.webp" alt="Bill Evans" class="post-image">

                <p>Evans discusses the step-by-step process of creative problem-solving.</p>

                <h2>Be real and true</h2>

                <p>People tend to approximate the product rather than attacking it in a realistic, true way at any
                    elementary level — regardless of how elementary — but it must be entirely true and entirely real and
                    entirely accurate. They would rather approximate the entire problem than to take a small part of it
                    and be real and true about it.</p>

                <h2>If you're confused, you won't find your way out</h2>

                <p>To approximate the whole thing in a vague way gives you a feeling that you've more or less touched
                    the thing, but in this way you just lead yourself toward confusion and ultimately you're going to
                    get so confused that you'll never find your way out.</p>

                <h2>Build on what you know</h2>

                <p>They're trying to do a thing in a way that is so general that they can't possibly build on that. If
                    they build on that, they're building on top of confusion and vagueness and they can't possibly
                    progress. If you try to approximate something that is very advanced and don't know what you're
                    doing, you can't advance.</p>

                <h2>Subconscious</h2>

                <p>The whole process of learning the facility to play jazz, is to take these problems from the outer
                    level in, one by one, and to stay with it at a very intense conscience concentration level, until
                    that process becomes secondary and subconscious. Now, when that becomes subconscious, then you can
                    begin concentrating on that next problem, which will allow you to do a little bit more…</p>
