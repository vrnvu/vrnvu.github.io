                <p>Adapted examples of emotional micromanagement:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>They attempt to be included in all casual conversations.</li>
                    <li>They will force team activities, off-sites, and treat the team as a family.</li>
                    <li>They constantly check how their employees feel and think it's their job to help them.</li>
                    <li>They ask for excessively frequent updates on feelings and personal topics they may think are
                        relevant for the employee's well-being.</li>
                    <li>They are the certified coaches and psychologists of the team. It's their job to help you fulfill

                    <li>They take pleasure in correcting how someone else deals with their mental health or soft skills.
                    </li>
                    <li>They will OKR your life and feelings. "When was the last time you visited your mom? How did that

                    <li>They never seem to be satisfied with how good you feel or how well you perform. The employee has
                        to always push and grind. Happiness must be achieved.</li>
