# The way of a true leader

A reflection on Ursula K. Le Guin.

## Acting simpliy

A true leader remains almost invisible to those they guide, letting their actions speak for themselves.

Lesser leaders may be known, admired, feared, or even despised. If someone is admired, feared, or despised for being a leader, can they truly be one? True leaders donâ€™t seek the spotlight.

Trust is a reflection. What you give is what you receive.

When work is done quietly and effectively, people will say, "We did it."
