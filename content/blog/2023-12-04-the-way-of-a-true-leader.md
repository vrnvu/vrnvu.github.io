# The way of a true leader

## Acting simpliy

True leaders
are hardly known to their followers.
Next after them are the leaders
the people know and admire;
after them, those they fear;
after them, those they despise.

To give no trust
is to get no trust.

When the workâ€™s done right,
with no fuss or boasting,
ordinary people say,
Oh, we did it.
