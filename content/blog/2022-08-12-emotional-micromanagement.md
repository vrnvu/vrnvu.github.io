# Emotional micromanagement

Examples of micromanagement that I found[^1] with a quick Google search:

- They ask to be copied on all emails from the team, whether they genuinely need to be included or not.
- They are reluctant to delegate even the most minor tasks to their team members.
- They constantly check where their employees are, seeing if they're at their desks or online, and may even monitor bathroom breaks.
- They ask for excessively frequent updates on even small tasks and check and double-check deadlines.
- They rarely ask for input from anyone else.
- They take pleasure in correcting someone else's work or pointing out very small errors.
- They scrutinize each task intently, no matter how small or low-priority the work is.
- They never seem to be satisfied with any work an employee performs.

Adapted examples of emotional micromanagement:

- They attempt to be included in all casual conversations.
- They will force team activities, off-sites, and treat the team as a family.
- They constantly check how their employees feel and think it's their job to help them.
- They ask for excessively frequent updates on feelings and personal topics they may think are relevant for the employee's well-being.
- They are the certified coaches and psychologists of the team. It's their job to help you fulfill your passions and goals!
- They take pleasure in correcting how someone else deals with their mental health or soft skills.
- They will OKR your life and feelings. "When was the last time you visited your mom? How did that make you feel? Can I help you? Let me help you!"
- They never seem to be satisfied with how good you feel or how well you perform. The employee has to always push and grind. Happiness must be achieved.
