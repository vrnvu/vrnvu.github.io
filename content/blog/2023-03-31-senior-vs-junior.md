# senior and junior engineers don't exists

Intern, junior, mid, senior, staff, principal... All of these positions where invented for political reasons. 

First of all, they serve a way to enforce a social hierarchy inside the company and teams. A principal or staff engineer doesn't have to justify a decission to an intern or a junior engineer in the team. Team dynamics are a cockfighting. Manager decides and acts as a leader the team follows. Seniority levels are above juniors and interns. Older people teaches the young. Oldsplanning. Man over women. *It's a Man's Man's Man's World*. Sadly this is the reallity in most companies if not all of them. I have plenty of female friends in engineering that are constantly harashed by their managers just because they are women. The same arguments just don't happen when the engineer is a male. It's sad.

What are some social constructions established in a tech work environment?

- An intern must be willing to learn and ask questions to learn.
- A junior engineer is someone who gets simple and easy tasks to be completed.
- A mid engineer is someone who has a limited scope of action. A mid engineer cannot have a big impact without the consent and approval of the upper levels.
- A senior engineer is someone with "the seniority" to make decissions. But do you have 10 years experience or just 1 year repeated 10 times?
- Staff and principal levels are defined as people who coordinate teams and are architect designers.
  
Let's forget about the creativity of people. Let's forget about all the new ideas that a female engineer can bring from another field to a new team. Let's forget about how great minds can work better when they have creative space to work. Let's ignore how big companies enforce political decissions to contributors team.
  
But this cockfighting goes further than work politics, it gets deeper into human behavior.

- Extroverts forcing one on one meetings with introverts to pressure them. Making the other side feel agitated and uncomfortable.
- Agressive managers kidnapping conversations until their ideas reach the end. They will promote this is engaging and they are active in the conversation when the truth is darker.
- Knowledge silos, people that feel threatened if they are rereplaceable. A good engineer loves to share with everyone what they can.
- Some people have big egos and hate when they lose an argument, turning everything into personal space. It's not about making the right decission, is about MY idea vs YOUR idea.

Stop making this hierarchies an excuse to harash others. Managers harashing engineers. Senior engineers harashing junior engineers. One team fighting another team. Stop justifying your behavior with void keywords. *I'm not harashing, I'm pushing an idea. I'm not micromanaging, I'm engaged. I'm not making a meeting to controll you, I want to have an open conversation.* Sure. But you make other people feel bad and you do it intentionally. 

Please, take it as an open letter. Stop talking about senior or junior engineers. Stop this hierarchies. Everyone is valuable. It doesn't matter how old are you, your ethnics or race, or your gender. It doesn't matter your background, your studies, everyone in a team is at the same level. Everyone in the team are collegues fighting for the same goals as you and everyone deserves to be treated with the same respect. Some people have fresher ideas, others have more experience in one fields, other have experience in other fields... We are human beings not headcounts. We are different and it's okay to be different.
