# senior and junior engineers don't exists

Intern, junior, mid, senior, staff, principal... All of these positions where invented for political reasons. 

First of all, they serve a way to enforce a social hierarchy inside the company and teams. A principal or staff engineer doesn't have to justify a decission to an intern or a junior engineer in the team. Team dynamics are a cockfighting. Manager decides and acts as a leader the team follows. Seniority levels are above juniors and interns. Older people teaches the young. Oldsplanning. Man over women. It's a Man's Man's Man's World. Sadly this is the reallity in most companies if not all of them. I have plenty of female friends in engineering that are constantly harashed by their managers just because they are women. The same arguments just don't happen when the engineer is a male. It's sad.

Secondly, they positions exits to limit the salary of employees. In order for an IC to increase their salary when a max salary band is reached is to go through a tedious promotion process that will normally take 1-2 years. A promotion can result in a 10% salary increase, but the same effort can be applied to changing jobs and getting a 20% salary increase.

What are some social constructions established in a tech work environment?

- An intern must be willing to learn and ask questions to learn.
- A junior engineer is someone who gets simple and easy tasks to be completed.
- A mid engineer is someone who has a limited scope of action. A mid engineer cannot have a big impact without the consent and approval of the upper levels.
- A senior engineer is someone with "the seniority" to make decissions. But do you have 10 years experience or just 1 year repeated 10 times?
- Staff and principal levels are defined as people who coordinate teams and are architect designers.

Please, take it as an open letter. Stop talking about senior or junior engineers. Everyone is valuable. It doesn't matter how old are you, your ethnics or race, or your gender. It doesn't matter your background, your studies, everyone in a team is in the same level. Everyone in the team are collegues fighting for the same goals as you and everyone deserves to be treated with the same respect. Some people have fresher ideas, others have more experience in one fields, other have experience in other fields... We are human beings not headcounts. We are different and it's okay to be different.
