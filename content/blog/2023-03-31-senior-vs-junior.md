Intern, junior, mid, senior, staff, principal... All of these positions where invented for political reasons. 

First of all, they serve a way to enforce a social hierarchy inside the company and teams. A principal or staff engineer doesn't have to justify a decission to an intern or a junior engineer in the team. Team dynamics are a cockfighting. Manager decides and acts as a leader the team follows. Seniority levels are above juniors and interns. Older people teaches the young. Oldsplanning. Man over women. It's a Man's Man's Man's World. Sadly this is the reallity in most companies if not all of them. I have plenty of female friends in engineering that are constantly harashed by their managers just because they are women. The same arguments just don't happen when the engineer is a male.

Secondly, they positions exits to limit the salary of employees. In order for an IC to increase their salary when a max salary band is reached is to go through a tedious promotion process that will normally take 1-2 years. A promotion can result in a 10% salary increase, but the same effort can be applied to changing jobs and getting a 20% salary increase.

- An intern must be willing to learn and ask questions to learn.
- A junior engineer is someone who gets simple and easy tasks to be completed.
- A mid engineer is someone who has a limited scope of action. A mid engineer cannot have a big impact without the consent and approval of the upper levels.
- A senior engineer is someone with "the seniority" to make decissions. But do you have 10 years experience or just 1 year repeated 10 times?
- Staff and principal levels are defined as people who coordinate teams and are architect designers.
