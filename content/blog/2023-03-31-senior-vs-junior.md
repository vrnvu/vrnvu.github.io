# senior and junior engineers don't exists

Intern, junior, mid, senior, staff, principal... These positions were invented for political reasons. 

First of all, they serve as a way to enforce a social hierarchy inside the company and teams. A principal or staff engineer doesn't have to justify a decision to an intern or a junior engineer in the team. Team dynamics are cockfighting. The manager decides and acts as a leader the team follows. Seniority levels are above juniors and interns. Older people teache the young. Oldsplanning. Man over women. *It's a Man's Man's Man's World*. Sadly, this is the reality in most companies if not all of them. Plenty of female friends in engineering are constantly harassed by their managers because they are women. The same arguments don't happen when the engineer is a male. It's sad.

What are some social constructions established in a tech work environment?

- An intern must be willing to learn and ask questions to learn.
- A junior engineer is someone who gets simple and easy tasks to be completed from their superiors.
- A mid engineer is someone who has a limited scope of action. A mid engineer cannot have a big impact without the consent and approval of the upper levels.
- A senior engineer is someone with "the seniority" to make resolutions. But do you have 10 years experience or 1 year repeated 10 times?
- Staff and principal levels are defined as people who coordinate teams and are architecture designers. Gurus and leaders to follow.
  
Let's forget about all the new ideas that a female engineer can bring from another field to a new team. Let's forget about how great minds can work better when they have a creative space to work. Let's forget we are people. We are juniors or seniors. Managers or subordinates. A hierarchy you can't escape. 
  
Cockfighting goes deeper than work politics, it gets deeper into human behavior.

- Extroverts forcing one on one meetings with introverts to pressure them. Making the other side feel agitated and uncomfortable.
- Aggressive managers kidnapping conversations until their ideas reach the end. They will justify themselves as being active and engaging when their real intentions is to assert dominance.
- Knowledge silos. People that feel threatened if they are replaceable. 
- When egos are hurt. Everything is taken into personal space. It's not about making the right decision, it's about MY idea vs YOUR idea. 

Please, take it as an open letter. Stop talking about senior or junior engineers. Stop harassment hierarchies. Everyone is valuable. It doesn't matter how old are you, your ethnics or race, or your gender. Stop cockfighting in meetings. It doesn't matter your background, your studies, everyone in a team is at the same level. And everyone deserves respect. We are human beings not headcounts. We are different and it's okay to be different.
