# Think in 3D

![2d vs 3d](https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/05/12/86/27/360_F_512862789_abYbb2RPLzpN8aAjteTBb4xGnRgqVSyw.jpg)

Imagine you and your team working on a product. 

As traffic increases, the team faces a decision on how to scale the product. 

You discuss:
- **Horizontal scaling**: adding more instances.
- **Vertical scaling**: changing the instance type to a bigger machine with more resources.

Pause for a moment. Did you notice something? If not, you might be seeing in 2D. Why limit your creative space to 2D? Consider also optimizing the application itself. Think in 3D. Enhancing the efficiency and performance of your application will offer better ways to manage growth.
