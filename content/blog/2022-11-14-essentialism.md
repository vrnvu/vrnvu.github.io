# The essentialist engineer 

> THE WISDOM OF LIFE CONSISTS IN THE ELIMINATION OF NON-ESSENTIALS - Lin Yutang

The essentiliast engineer

- **Thinks**: "I choose to.", "Only a few things really matter.", "What are the trade-offs?".
- **Does**: Pauses to discern what really matters. Says "no" to everything but the essential. Removes obstracles to make execution easy.
- **Gets**: Great work. Feels in control. Gets the right thing done. Experiences joy in the journey.

## How an essentialist approaches a problem?

1. **Explores**: Discerning the trivial many from the vital few.

2. **Eliminates**: Cutting out the trivial many.

3. **Executes**: Removing obstacles and making execution effortless.
