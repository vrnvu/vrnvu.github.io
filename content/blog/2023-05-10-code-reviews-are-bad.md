# Code reviews are bad

Code reviews don't make the code better.

**Code reviews are a mechanism to dilute responsibility.**

And in today's software engineering, responsibility is virtually nonexistent.

We all make mistakes.

Having someone approve that pull request makes us share responsibility.

Consequently, a worse quality job is done.

- Responsibility => Quality
- No responsibility => No quality

Code reviews are only useful if people take responsibility.

Without it, code reviews can be ineffective and even harmful.

The same concept applies to pair programming, design patterns, unit testing.
