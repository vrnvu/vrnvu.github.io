# The way of the engineer

- a roman poet remarked that travelers change their sky but not their soul.

- nothing in the world is as soft, as weak, as water; nothing else can wear away the hard, the strong, and remain unaltered. soft overcomes hard, weak overcomes strong.

- so the unwanting soul sees what’s hidden, and the ever-wanting soul sees only what it wants.

- to believe that our beliefs are permanent truths which encompass reality is a sad arrogance.

- heaven and earth aren’t humane. to them the ten thousand things are straw dogs.

- why let the self go? to keep what the soul needs.

- heaven will last, earth will endure. how can they last so long? they don’t exist for themselves and so can go on and on.
