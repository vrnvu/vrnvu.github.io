# Creative space and time

Software engineering is driven by human creativity and problem-solving. For some, it is even regarded as a form of [art](https://arnaudiaz.com/blog/programming-as-an-art/).

- **Space** allows engineers, as people, to choose their projects, methods, and tools. This freedom encourages personal expression and unique approaches to solving problems.

- **Time** gives engineers the ability to set their own pace for releasing features, working on them, collaborating and making improvements. This flexibility supports thoughtful exploration and refinement.
