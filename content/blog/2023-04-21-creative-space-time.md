# Creative space and time

I remember one time when I was in a meeting where we had to list the positives and negatives of our product. Our software had been in production for over six years and it was quite mature. As we went around the room, most of the discussion focused on the challenges of evaluating a product that had been in use for so long.

When it was my turn, I spoke up and shared a positive point of a mature product: we had control over our creative space and time. "I like to speak in alien sometimes," I joked. "So let me translate what I mean into everyday language and give you some examples.".

## Space and time

Software engineering is all about creativity and solving problems. Some people like me even consider it an [art](https://arnaudiaz.com/blog/programming-as-an-art/) form.

- **Space** means that engineers can choose what they work on, how they work on it, and which tools and libraries to use. This gives them the freedom to create innovative solutions and go beyond what is expected.

- **Time** lets engineers decide when to release a feature, how long to work on it, and how to improve it. With creative time, there's no need to rush and it encourages experimentation and refinement.
