Two quick definitions, from one of the best courses I've taken¹:

- **Syntax**: The rules that say what counts as valid code. Punctuation, keywords, structure.
- **Semantics**: The meaning of that code. What it does, what it represents.

**So what's code readability?** 

Readability is syntax that makes semantics obvious.

- It's not about imperative vs functional. 
- It's not about tabs, spaces, or where the braces go.
- It's about clarity.
- It's about mutability, iterating, cloning. 
- It's about moving or cloning values. 
- It's about understanding if we're dealing with a value or a reference.

A **good** language is **readable**. A readable language makes **semantics** obvious. A good programmer encourages that kind of readability.
