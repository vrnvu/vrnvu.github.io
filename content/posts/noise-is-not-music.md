On [Simulacra and Simulation](https://arnau.bearblog.dev/simulacra-and-simulation/) we see how easily we mistake motion for meaning. [Borges](http://arnau.bearblog.dev/borges/) wrote that two mirrors are enough to create a labyrinth. Now, consider sound.

We make noise to be noticed. We announce, post, ping, repeat. Sometimes visibility, sometimes ego. Noise tempts us because it feels like progress. It gives shape to uncertainty. It fills gaps that should stay empty for real work to happen. But like Borges’ mirrors, it creates infinite reflections—convincing, familiar, and entirely false.

Noise multiplies faster than information. Give it a little time and it becomes process, then ceremony, then meetings about ceremony. Some projects get buried under people who talk more than they build. Too many teams optimize for communication instead of creation.

Communication should be simple: Alice talks, Bob listens. If both understand each other, the meeting succeeds. If a meeting needs another meeting to explain it, that’s management.

Listen, focus, be quiet. Don't talk too much. [Do one thing](https://strangestloop.io/essays/things-that-arent-doing-the-thing) and do it well.  

Noise isn't music. Noise is just noise.
