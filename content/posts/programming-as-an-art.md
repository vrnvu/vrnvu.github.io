art once meant skill: a practice, not a product.  
we've lost that meaning.

## where "art" came from

the latin _ars_ and greek _techne_ both meant skill.  
from _techne_ we get _technology_, _technique_: doing things well, with care.

before the 20th century, art didn't mean painting or sculpture.  
it meant logic, reason, method.  
art was human intellect, applied.

## science and art

- science was knowing. 
- art was doing.

you learned the science of the stars to practice the art of navigation.  
today science gives us theory, engineering puts it to work.

## writing programs

programming can feel like writing music or shaping a line of poetry.  
you build structure, tame complexity, find rhythm.  
sometimes itâ€™s hard, sometimes it flows.

but the best programs aren't just functional, they feel _finished_.  
clear. precise. expressive.

we've all seen them:

- programs that are **elegant**.  
- programs that are **exquisite**.  
- programs that are **sparkling**.

this is what it means to treat programming as an art.
