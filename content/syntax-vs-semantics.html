                <p>Two definitions quoting one of our favourite courses<sup>1</sup>.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Syntax</strong>. By syntax, we mean the rules that define what forms a well-formed
                        program in the language. Including the keywords, restrictions on whitespace and formatting,
                        punctuation, operators, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Semantics</strong>. By semantics, we mean the rules that define the behavior of
                        programs. In other words, semantics is about the meaning of a program—what computation a
                        particular piece of syntax represents. Note that although "semantics" is plural in form, we use
                        it as singular. That's like "mathematics" or "physics".</li>
                </ul>

                <p>So then, what is code readability?</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Code readability = syntax that make semantics obvious.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If a block of code is written in an imperative style or functional style doesn't matter. Ask yourself
                    instead, are the semantics clear? Are we coping or moving the values? Are we cloning the references?
                    Are we iterating over mutable references or copies of the value?</p>

                <p>A good language, with good code readability, makes semantics obvious. A good programmer, encourages
                    good readability. With good readability we don't have doubts about what a piece of code is doing.
