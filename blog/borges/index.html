Mirrors deceive.<p>Simplifying abstractions is to submerge oneself in the limitless complexity of reality. Myriads of grains of sand.<blockquote><p>It only takes two facing mirrors to build a labyrinth.</blockquote><p>Our fate is either to perish, disoriented in the labyrinth, or to be swallowed by the sands.<h2 id=on-exactitude-in-science>On Exactitude in Science</h2><blockquote><p>... In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.</blockquote><h2 id=the-writing-of-the-god>The Writing of the God</h2><blockquote><p>One day or one night—between my days and nights, what difference can there be?—I dreamed that there was a grain of sand on the floor of my cell. Unconcerned, I went back to sleep; I dreamed that I woke up and there were two grains of sand. Again I slept; I dreamed that now there were three. Thus the grains of sand multiplied, little by little, until they filled the cell and I was dying beneath that hemisphere of sand. I realized that I was dreaming; with a vast effort I woke myself. But waking up was useless—I was suffocated by the countless sand. Someone said to me: You have wakened not out of sleep, but into a prior dream, and that dream lies within another, and so on, to infinity, which is the number of the grains of sand. The path that you are to take is endless, and you will die before you have truly awakened.</blockquote><h2 id=the-two-kings-and-the-two-labyrinths>The Two Kings and the Two Labyrinths</h2><blockquote><p>It is said by men worthy of belief (though Allah’s knowledge is greater) that in the first days there was a king of the isles of Babylonia who called together his architects and his priests and bade them build him a labyrinth so confused and so subtle that the most prudent men would not venture to enter it, and those who did would lose their way. Most unseemly was the edifice that resulted, for it is the prerogative of God, not man, to strike confusion and inspire wonder. In time there came to the court a king of Arabs, and the king of Babylonia (to muck the simplicity of his guest) bade him enter the labyrinth, where the king of Arabs wandered, humiliated and confused, until the coming of the evening, when he implored God’s aid and found the door. His lips offered no complaint, though he said to the king of Babylonia that in his land he had another labyrinth, and Allah willing, he would see that someday the king of Babylonia made its acquaintance. Then he returned to Arabia with his captains and his wardens and he wreaked such havoc upon kingdoms of Babylonia, and with such great blessing by fortune, that he brought low his castles, crushed his people, and took the king of Babylonia himself captive. He tied him atop a swift-footed camel and led him into the desert. Three days they rode, and then he said to him, “O king of time and substance and cipher of the century! In Babylonia didst thou attempt to make me lose my way in a labyrinth of brass with many stairways, doors, and walls; now the Powerful One has seen fit to allow me to show thee mine, which has no stairways to climb, nor walls to impede thy passage.” Then he untied the bonds of the king of Babylonia and abandoned him in the middle of the desert, where he died of hunger and thirst. Glory to him who does not die.</blockquote></article></main><aside class=blur><nav><ul><li><a class=toc-h2 href=#borges>Borges</a> <ul><li><a class=toc-h3 href=#on-exactitude-in-science>On Exactitude in Science</a><li><a class=toc-h3 href=#the-writing-of-the-god>The Writing of the God</a><li><a class=toc-h3 href=#the-two-kings-and-the-two-labyrinths>The Two Kings and the Two Labyrinths</a></ul></ul></nav><a aria-label="back to top" href=#top id=back-to-top><i class="ri-arrow-up-s-line ri-2x"></i></a></aside></div><footer><div class=copyright>i don't believe in copyright</div></footer><script src=/js/dark.js></script><script src=/js/toc.js></script><script src=/js/progress.js></script><script src=/js/lightense.min.js></script><script src=/js/img.js></script>
