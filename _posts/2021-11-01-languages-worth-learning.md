# What language should I learn next?

A couple of entries about learning have been posted in the blog. If you have read them, you will have notice how the context and the personal motivation matters. Start with the why. Find your final goal and set small objectives that will help you reach it. Knowing why we want to achieve something is the first step to obtain it. So, let's me answer your question with another question to guide you:

Why do you want to learn a new language in the first place? Well, it turns out that the the answer will always depend on two factors, your current context and your motivation. Everyone one has a context, our situation, external factors that define our life. Paying the rent, saving money for emergencies, parenthood... And everyone also has motivations which are moved by internal thoughts. Who I want to be in life? Where I want to be in the next years? What are my hobbies and who I spend my time with? 

Going back to our initial question. Most people program as a job or as a hobby or as both. Therefore, unless more details are provided we will get two answers from one question.

I want to learn for the sake of learning:

>"A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing." Alan Parlis

I want to learn because I'm starting this new job or I want to change my career:

>"Don't worry. you will learn it at work." Everyone

## Now really, what language should I learn next?

This is my opinion. This is a list of langauges that are worth learning on 2021. Others[^1] opinions have been stated in the past obviously. They are outdated but I encourage you to also read others suggestions. 

Let's start. You should first learn Basic and then C. Why? Because the list is in alphabetical order and I would not recommend APL to my worst enemy.

- **Basic**: Should be your first language.

- **C**: Introduction to memory management and systems programming.

- **Elixir**: I recommend it over Erlang simply because it's contemporary. The VM is gorgeus. Elixir is real OOP. If you want to learn OOP this should be your choice.

- **Forth**: Thinking Fourth. Forth Philosophy. 

- **Go**: Enterprise every day language that I recommend. Also CSP.

- **J or Kona**: Data models.

- **Ocaml**: A good language and a good type system.

- **Racket**: To learn functional programming you need LISP. HMs: Scheme and Clojure. 

- **Rust**: Functional programming applied in memory management.

If your langauge of choice is not in the list, does it mean that it's not worth learning? Probably yes. 

But here is a list of HMs: ADA, ATS, Coq, Haskell, Idris, Julia, Lean, Mercury, Nim, Shen, Zig.
