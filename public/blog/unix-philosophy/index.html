It is pragmatic and grounded in experience. It is not to be found in official methods and standards, but rather in the implicit half-reflexive knowledge, the expertise that the Unix culture transmits. It encourages a sense of proportion and skepticism — and shows both by having a sense of (often subversive) humor.<h2 id=there-is-no-rule-six>There is no rule six</h2><ol><li><p>You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and put in a speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is.</p><li><p><strong>Measure</strong>. Don't tune for speed until you've measured, and even then don't unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest.</p><li><p>Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small. Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know that n is frequently going to be big, <strong>don't get fancy</strong>. (Even if n does get big, use Rule 2 first.)</p><li><p>Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and they're much harder to implement. <strong>Use simple algorithms as well as simple data structures</strong>.</p><li><p><strong>Data dominates</strong>. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.</p><li><p>There is no Rule 6. <sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#2>2</a></sup></p></ol><h1 id=rule-of-modularity>Rule of Modularity</h1><blockquote><p>Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces</blockquote><p><strong>“Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming”</strong>. Debugging dominates development time, and getting a working system out the door is usually less a result of brilliant design than it is of managing not to trip over your own feet too many times.<p>The only way to write complex software that won't fall on its face is to hold its global complexity down — to build it out of simple parts connected by well-defined interfaces, so that most problems are local and you can have some hope of upgrading a part without breaking the whole.<h1 id=rule-of-clarity>Rule of Clarity</h1><blockquote><p>Clarity is better than cleverness</blockquote><p>Because maintenance is so important and so expensive, write programs as if the most important communication they do is not to the computer that executes them but to the human beings who will read and maintain the source code in the future (including yourself).<p>Good Unix practice also embraces choosing your algorithms and implementations for future maintainability. Buying a small increase in performance with a large increase in the complexity and obscurity of your technique is a bad trade.<p><strong>Code that is graceful and clear, on the other hand, is less likely to break</strong>.<h1 id=rule-of-composition>Rule of Composition</h1><blockquote><p>Design programs to be connected with other programs</blockquote><p>It's hard to avoid programming overcomplicated monoliths if none of your programs can talk to each other.<p>Unix tradition strongly encourages writing programs that read and write simple, textual, stream-oriented, device-independent formats. Under classic Unix, as many programs as possible are written as simple filters, which take a simple text stream on input and process it into another simple text stream on output.<p>Despite popular mythology, this practice is favored not because Unix programmers hate graphical user interfaces. It's because if you don't write programs that accept and emit simple text streams, it's much more difficult to hook the programs together.<p>To make programs composable, make them independent. <strong>A program on one end of a text stream should care as little as possible about the program on the other end. It should be made easy to replace one end with a completely different implementation without disturbing the other.</strong><h1 id=rule-of-separation>Rule of Separation</h1><blockquote><p>Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines</blockquote><p>Hardwiring policy and mechanism together has two bad effects: It makes policy rigid and harder to change in response to user requirements, and it means that trying to change policy has a strong tendency to destabilize the mechanisms.<p>On the other hand, by separating the two we make it possible to experiment with new policy without breaking mechanisms. We also make it much easier to write good tests for the mechanism (policy, because it ages so quickly, often does not justify the investment).<h1 id=rule-of-simplicity>Rule of Simplicity</h1><blockquote><p>Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must</blockquote><p>Many pressures tend to make programs more complicated (and therefore more expensive and buggy). One such pressure is technical machismo. Programmers are bright people who are (often justly) proud of their ability to handle complexity and juggle abstractions. Often they compete with their peers to see who can build the most intricate and beautiful complexities. Just as often, their ability to design outstrips their ability to implement and debug, and the result is expensive failure.<p>The only way to avoid these traps is to <strong>encourage a software culture that knows that small is beautiful, that actively resists bloat and complexity</strong>: an engineering tradition that puts a high value on simple solutions, that looks for ways to break program systems up into small cooperating pieces, and that reflexively fights attempts to gussy up programs with a lot of chrome (or, even worse, to design programs around the chrome).<h1 id=rule-of-parsimony>Rule of Parsimony</h1><blockquote><p>Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do</blockquote><p>‘Big’ here has the sense both of large in volume of code and of internal complexity. Allowing programs to get large hurts maintainability. Because people are reluctant to throw away the visible product of lots of work, large programs invite overinvestment in approaches that are failed or suboptimal.<h1 id=rule-of-transparency>Rule of Transparency</h1><blockquote><p>Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier</blockquote><p>Because debugging often occupies three-quarters or more of development time, work done early to ease debugging can be a very good investment. A particularly effective way to ease debugging is to design for transparency and discoverability.<p><strong>A software system is transparent when you can look at it and immediately understand what it is doing and how</strong>. It is discoverable when it has facilities for monitoring and display of internal state so that your program not only functions well but can be seen to function well.<p>Designing for these qualities will have implications throughout a project. At minimum, it implies that <strong>debugging options should not be minimal afterthoughts. Rather, they should be designed in from the beginning</strong> — from the point of view that the program should be able to both demonstrate its own correctness and communicate to future developers the original developer's mental model of the problem it solves.<p>For a program to demonstrate its own correctness, it needs to be using input and output formats sufficiently simple so that the proper relationship between valid input and correct output is easy to check.<p>The objective of designing for transparency and discoverability should also encourage simple interfaces that can easily be manipulated by other programs — in particular, test and monitoring harnesses and debugging scripts.<h1 id=rule-of-robustness>Rule of Robustness</h1><blockquote><p>Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity</blockquote><p>Software is said to be robust when it performs well under unexpected conditions which stress the designer's assumptions, as well as under normal conditions.<p>Most software is fragile and buggy because most programs are too complicated for a human brain to understand all at once. When you can't reason correctly about the guts of a program, you can't be sure it's correct, and you can't fix it if it's broken.<p>One very important tactic for being robust under odd inputs is to avoid having special cases in your code. Bugs often lurk in the code for handling special cases, and in the interactions among parts of the code intended to handle different special cases.<p>We observed above that software is transparent when you can look at it and immediately see what is going on. It is simple when what is going on is uncomplicated enough for a human brain to reason about all the potential cases without strain. The more your programs have both of these qualities, the more robust they will be.<p>Modularity (simple parts, clean interfaces) is a way to organize programs to make them simpler. There are other ways to fight for simplicity. Here's another one.<h1 id=rule-of-representation>Rule of Representation</h1><blockquote><p>Fold knowledge into data, so program logic can be stupid and robust</blockquote><p>Even the simplest procedural logic is hard for humans to verify, but quite complex data structures are fairly easy to model and reason about.<p>Data is more tractable than program logic. It follows that where you see a choice between complexity in data structures and complexity in code, choose the former. More: in evolving a design, you should actively seek ways to shift complexity from code to data.<h1 id=rule-of-least-surprise>Rule of Least Surprise</h1><blockquote><p>In interface design, always do the least surprising thing</blockquote><p>The easiest programs to use are those that demand the least new learning from the user — or, to put it another way, the easiest programs to use are those that most effectively connect to the user's pre-existing knowledge.<p>Therefore, avoid gratuitous novelty and excessive cleverness in interface design. If you're writing a calculator program, ‘+’ should always mean addition! When designing an interface, model it on the interfaces of functionally similar or analogous programs with which your users are likely to be familiar.<p>Pay attention to your expected audience. They may be end users, they may be other programmers, or they may be system administrators. What is least surprising can differ among these groups.<p>Pay attention to tradition. The Unix world has rather well-developed conventions about things like the format of configuration and run-control files, command-line switches, and the like. These traditions exist for a good reason: to tame the learning curve. Learn and use them.<h1 id=rule-of-silence>Rule of Silence</h1><blockquote><p>When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing</blockquote><p>One of Unix's oldest and most persistent design rules is that when a program has nothing interesting or surprising to say, it should shut up. Well-behaved Unix programs do their jobs unobtrusively, with a minimum of fuss and bother. Silence is golden.<p>Well-designed programs treat the user's attention and concentration as a precious and limited resource, only to be claimed when necessary.<h1 id=rule-of-repair>Rule of Repair</h1><blockquote><p>Repair what you can — but when you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible</blockquote><p><strong>Write your software to cope with incorrect inputs and its own execution errors as gracefully as possible. But when it cannot, make it fail in a way that makes diagnosis of the problem as easy as possible.</strong><h1 id=rule-of-economy>Rule of Economy</h1><p>Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time<p>One other obvious way to conserve programmer time is to teach machines how to do more of the low-level work of programming. This leads to...<h1 id=rule-of-generation>Rule of Generation</h1><blockquote><p>Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can</blockquote><p>Human beings are notoriously bad at sweating the details. Accordingly, any kind of hand-hacking of programs is a rich source of delays and errors. The simpler and more abstracted your program specification can be, the more likely it is that the human designer will have gotten it right. Generated code (at every level) is almost always cheaper and more reliable than hand-hacked.<p>In the Unix tradition, code generators are heavily used to automate error-prone detail work. Parser/lexer generators are the classic examples; makefile generators and GUI interface builders are newer ones.<h1 id=rule-of-optimization>Rule of Optimization</h1><blockquote><p>Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it</blockquote><p>In the Unix world there is a long-established and very explicit tradition (exemplified by Rob Pike's comments above and Ken Thompson's maxim about brute force) that says: <strong>Prototype, then polish. Get it working before you optimize it. Or: Make it work first, then make it work fast</strong>. ‘Extreme programming' guru Kent Beck, operating in a different culture, has usefully amplified this to: “Make it run, then make it right, then make it fast”.<p>Using prototyping to learn which features you don't have to implement helps optimization for performance; you don't have to optimize what you don't write. The most powerful optimization tool in existence may be the delete key.<h1 id=rule-of-diversity>Rule of Diversity</h1><blockquote><p>Distrust all claims for “one true way”</blockquote><p>Even the best software tools tend to be limited by the imaginations of their designers. Nobody is smart enough to optimize for everything, nor to anticipate all the uses to which their software might be put. Designing rigid, closed software that won't talk to the rest of the world is an unhealthy form of arrogance.<p>Therefore, the Unix tradition includes a healthy mistrust of “one true way” approaches to software design or implementation. It embraces multiple languages, open extensible systems, and customization hooks everywhere.<h1 id=rule-of-extensibility>Rule of Extensibility</h1><blockquote><p>Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think</blockquote><p>If it is unwise to trust other people's claims for “one true way”, it's even more foolish to believe them about your own designs. Never assume you have the final answer. Therefore, leave room for your data formats and code to grow; otherwise, you will often find that you are locked into unwise early choices because you cannot change them while maintaining backward compatibility.<p>When you design protocols or file formats, make them sufficiently self-describing to be extensible. Always, always either include a version number, or compose the format from self-contained, self-describing clauses in such a way that new clauses can be readily added and old ones dropped without confusing format-reading code. Unix experience tells us that the marginal extra overhead of making data layouts self-describing is paid back a thousandfold by the ability to evolve them forward without breaking things.<p>When you design code, organize it so future developers will be able to plug new functions into the architecture without having to scrap and rebuild the architecture. This rule is not a license to add features you don't yet need; it's advice to write your code so that adding features later when you do need them is easy. Make the joints flexible, and put “If you ever need to...” comments in your code. You owe this grace to people who will use and maintain your code after you.<p>You'll be there in the future too, maintaining code you may have half forgotten under the press of more recent projects. When you design for the future, the sanity you save may be your own.<hr><h1 id=footnotes>Footnotes</h1><div class=footnote-definition id=1><sup class=footnote-definition-label>1</sup><p><em>Basics of the Unix Philosophy Chapter 1.
