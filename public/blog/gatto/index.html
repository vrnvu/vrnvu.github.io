The children are numbered so that if any get away they can be returned to the right class.<p>In any case, again, that's not my business. My job is to make the kids like it -- being locked in together, I mean -- or at the minimum, endure it. If things go well, the kids can't imagine themselves anywhere else; they envy and fear the better classes and have contempt for the dumber classes. So the class mostly keeps itself in good marching order. That's the real lesson of any rigged competition like school. You come to know your place.<p><strong>The lesson of numbered classes is that there is no way out of your class except by magic. Until that happens you must stay where you are put.</strong><h2 id=second-lesson>Second lesson</h2><blockquote><p>Turn on and off like a light switch</blockquote><p>I demand that they become totally involved in my lessons, jumping up and down in their seats with anticipation, competing vigorously with each other for my favor. But when the bell rings I insist that they drop the work at once and proceed quickly to the next work station. <strong>Nothing important is ever finished in my class, nor in any other class I know of.</strong><h2 id=third-lesson>Third lesson</h2><blockquote><p>Surrender your will to a predestined chain of command</blockquote><p>Rights may be granted or withheld, by authority, without appeal. As a schoolteacher I intervene in many personal decisions, issuing a Pass for those I deem legitimate, or initiating a disciplinary confrontation for behavior that threatens my control. My judgments come thick and fast, because individuality is trying constantly to assert itself in my classroom. <strong>Individuality is a curse to all systems of classification, a contradiction of class theory.</strong><h2 id=fourth-lesson>Fourth lesson</h2><blockquote><p>I determine what curriculum you will study</blockquote><p>(Rather, I enforce decisions transmitted by the people who pay me). This power lets me separate good kids from bad kids instantly. Good kids do the tasks I appoint with a minimum of conflict and a decent show of enthusiasm. Of the millions of things of value to learn, I decide what few we have time for. The choices are mine. Curiosity has no important place in my work, only conformity.<p>Bad kids fight against this, of course, trying openly or covertly to make decisions for themselves about what they will learn. How can we allow that and survive as schoolteachers? Fortunately there are procedures to break the will of those who resist.<p>This is another way I teach the lesson of dependency. <strong>Good people wait for a teacher to tell them what to do.</strong> This is the most important lesson of all, that we must wait for other people, better trained than ourselves, to make the meanings of our lives.<h2 id=fifth-lesson>Fifth lesson</h2><blockquote><p>Your self-respect should depend on an observer's measure of your worth</blockquote><p><strong>My kids are constantly evaluated and judged.</strong> A monthly report, impressive in its precision, is sent into students' homes to spread approval or to mark exactly -- down to a single percentage point -- how dissatisfied with their children parents should be.<p>Self-evaluation -- the staple of every major philosophical system that ever appeared on the planet -- is never a factor in these things. The lesson of report cards, grades, and tests is that children should not trust themselves or their parents, but must rely on the evaluation of certified officials. <strong>People need to be told what they are worth.</strong><h2 id=sixth-lesson>Sixth lesson</h2><blockquote><p>I teach children that they are being watched</blockquote><p>I keep each student under constant surveillance and so do my colleagues. There are no private spaces for children; there is no private time. Class change lasts 300 seconds to keep promiscuous fraternization at low levels. Students are encouraged to tattle on each other, even to tattle on their parents. Of course I encourage parents to file their own child's waywardness, too.<p><strong>I assign "homework" so that this surveillance extends into the household, where students might otherwise use the time to learn something unauthorized</strong>, perhaps from a father or mother, or by apprenticing to some wiser person in the neighborhood.<p><strong>The lesson of constant surveillance is that no one can be trusted, that privacy is not legitimate.</strong> Surveillance is an ancient urgency among certain influential thinkers; it was a central prescription set down by Calvin in the Institutes, by Plato in the Republic, by Hobbes, by Comte, by Francis Bacon. All these childless men discovered the same thing: Children must be closely watched if you want to keep a society under central control.<hr><h1 id=footnotes>Footnotes</h1><div class=footnote-definition id=1><sup class=footnote-definition-label>1</sup><p><em>Thanks to Nathan Myers</em> <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.cantrip.org/gatto.html>gatto</a></div></article></main><aside class=blur><nav><ul><li><a class=toc-h2 href=#the-six-lesson-schoolteacher>The Six-Lesson Schoolteacher</a> <ul><li><a class=toc-h3 href=#first-lesson>First lesson</a><li><a class=toc-h3 href=#second-lesson>Second lesson</a><li><a class=toc-h3 href=#third-lesson>Third lesson</a><li><a class=toc-h3 href=#fourth-lesson>Fourth lesson</a><li><a class=toc-h3 href=#fifth-lesson>Fifth lesson</a><li><a class=toc-h3 href=#sixth-lesson>Sixth lesson</a></ul><li><a class=toc-h2 href=#footnotes>Footnotes</a></ul></nav><a aria-label="back to top" href=#top id=back-to-top><i class="ri-arrow-up-s-line ri-2x"></i></a></aside></div><footer><div class=copyright>i don't believe in copyright</div></footer><script src=/js/dark.js></script><script src=/js/toc.js></script><script src=/js/progress.js></script><script src=/js/lightense.min.js></script><script src=/js/img.js></script>
